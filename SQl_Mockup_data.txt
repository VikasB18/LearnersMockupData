What are the Top 25 schools (.edu domains)?
How many .edu learners are located in New York?
The mobile_app column contains either mobile-user or NULL. How many of these Codecademy learners are using the mobile app?

SELECT email_domain, COUNT (*) as students
FROM users
WHERE email_domain LIKE '%.edu'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY students DESC
LIMIT 25;


SELECT COUNT(*) as 'Learners in New York'
FROM users
WHERE city = 'New York';

SELECT COUNT(*) as 'Learners using mobile app'
FROM users
WHERE mobile_app IS NOT NULL;

3.     List sign-up counts per hour formatting

SELECT
 strftime('%H', sign_up_at) AS 'Hour of the day', COUNT(*) AS 'Learners signed up'
FROM users
GROUP BY 1;

4. 
Join the two tables using JOIN and then see what you can dig out of the data!

Do different schools (.edu domains) prefer different courses?
SELECT u.email_domain, 
       p.learn_cpp, 
       p.learn_sql, 
       p.learn_html, 
       p.learn_javascript, 
       p.learn_java 
FROM users as u 
JOIN progress as p 
ON u.user_id = p.user_id 
WHERE u.email_domain LIKE '%.edu' 
GROUP BY u.email_domain;

What courses are the New Yorkers students taking?

SELECT u.city, 
       p.learn_cpp, 
       p.learn_sql, 
       p.learn_html, 
       p.learn_javascript, 
       p.learn_java 
FROM users u 
JOIN progress p 
ON u.user_id = p.user_id 
WHERE u.city LIKE '%New York%' 
GROUP BY u.city;


What courses are the Chicago students taking?

FROM users u 
JOIN progress p 
ON u.user_id = p.user_id 
WHERE u.city LIKE '%Chicago%' 
GROUP BY u.city;
